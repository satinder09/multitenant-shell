# Development Workflow

## Before Making Changes
- Understand the current architecture and data flow
- Check existing implementations to avoid conflicts
- Plan the changes with proper error handling
- Consider security implications of any changes

## During Development
- Test incrementally - don't make too many changes at once
- Use proper logging to track execution flow
- Handle edge cases and error conditions
- Maintain type safety throughout the codebase

## After Making Changes
- Test the complete flow end-to-end
- Check for linting errors and fix them
- Verify build process works correctly
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Update documentation if needed
