# XoroERP Lite - SaaS Shell Project Plan

## 1. Project Vision

To build a fully domain-independent, enterprise-grade SaaS application shell designed for multi-tenant, horizontally scalable, and highly secure deployments. This framework will provide all the essential architecture, security, tenancy, user management, RBAC, theming, and extensibility foundations needed to launch any vertical business module as a plug-in. It will serve as a reusable core for any future SaaS product, ensuring rapid development, robust compliance, and operational excellence from day one.

---

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Domain-Agnostic:** The shell will contain zero business logic. All features will be platform-level.
- **Security First:** Every API endpoint and UI component will be protected by default.
- **Extensibility by Design:** The architecture will be built around a plugin model for future business modules.
- **Automated & Scalable:** Tenant lifecycle, deployments, and infrastructure will be managed through code and automation.
- **Developer Experience:** The shell must be easy to understand, extend, and maintain.
- **Environment Flexibility:** All domains, ports, and configurations must be environment-driven.
- **Component Reusability:** Prioritize existing user-defined components over creating new ones.

- **Use consistent naming conventions** across backend and frontend
- **Validate environment variables** at startup with proper error messages
- **Test with different configurations** to ensure flexibility

### Component Architecture
- **Always check existing user-defined components first** before creating new ones
- **Follow component hierarchy**: ui-kit ‚Üí ui ‚Üí utils ‚Üí extend ‚Üí create new
- **Use established patterns** in existing user-defined components
- **Leverage existing TypeScript interfaces** from user-defined components

### Security & Authentication

- **Use secure session management** with proper cookie handling
- **Audit all authentication events** for security compliance
- **Validate tenant context** on every request

### Development Workflow
- **Test incrementally** - don't make too many changes at once
- **Use proper logging** to track execution flow
- **Handle edge cases** and error conditions
