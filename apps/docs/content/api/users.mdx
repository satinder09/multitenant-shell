# Multitenant Shell - Users API

Comprehensive Users API documentation for the multitenant shell application.

This API provides complete user management functionality including creation, retrieval, updating, and deletion of users within tenant contexts.

## Key Features

- **Complete CRUD Operations**: Create, read, update, and delete users
- **Advanced Filtering**: Search users by name, email, role, and status
- **Pagination**: Efficient handling of large user datasets
- **Role-based Access**: Support for different user roles (user, admin, manager)
- **Status Management**: Handle active, inactive, and suspended users
- **Comprehensive Validation**: Robust input validation with detailed error messages

## Authentication

This API uses JWT-based authentication with two supported methods:
1. **Bearer Token**: Include JWT in Authorization header
2. **HTTP-Only Cookie**: Automatic cookie-based authentication

## Rate Limiting

Standard API rate limiting applies to all endpoints to ensure fair usage.

## API Information

- **Version**: 1.0.0
- **Base URL**: http://localhost:4000
- **Total Endpoints**: 2
- **Authentication**: Bearer Token / Cookie-based

## Available Operations

### GET /users
Retrieve a paginated list of users with filtering and sorting options.

### POST /users
Create a new user in the current tenant.

### GET /users/\{id\}

### PATCH /users/\{id\}
Update user information (partial update).

### DELETE /users/\{id\}
Permanently delete a user from the tenant.

## Authentication

This API uses JWT-based authentication. You can authenticate using:

1. **Bearer Token**: Include the JWT token in the Authorization header
   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <your-jwt-token>
   ```

2. **HTTP-Only Cookie**: The API automatically reads JWT tokens from the 'Authentication' cookie

## User Roles

The API supports three user roles:
- **user**: Standard user with basic permissions
- **admin**: Administrative user with elevated permissions
- **manager**: Management user with intermediate permissions

## User Status

Users can have the following statuses:
- **active**: User can access the system
- **inactive**: User account is temporarily disabled
- **suspended**: User account is suspended due to policy violations

## Rate Limiting

Standard API rate limiting applies to all endpoints to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse.

## Error Handling

All endpoints return consistent error responses:

```json
{
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": ["email must be a valid email"],
  "error": "Bad Request"
}
```

Common HTTP status codes:
- **200**: Success
- **201**: Created
- **400**: Bad Request (validation errors)
- **401**: Unauthorized (authentication required)
- **403**: Forbidden (insufficient permissions)
- **404**: Not Found (user doesn't exist)
- **409**: Conflict (email already exists)

## Example Usage

### Create a New User

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:4000/users \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john.doe@example.com",
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "role": "user"
  }'
```

### Get Users with Filtering
